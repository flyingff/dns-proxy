# dns-proxy

It's a java-written DNS local proxy tool, developed by Idea with Kotlin & Java. No other external libraries are refereced.

It's intented to be used for converting DNS request from UDP to TCP protocol. But now it has some feature about monitoring DNS requests and replies with a Swing GUI. Also you can switch upper-stream DNS server in the GUI.

More features like DNS cache and configurable DNS server will be developed sometime later.
